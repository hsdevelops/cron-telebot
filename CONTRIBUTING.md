## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue. 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start working your magic!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your PR, your changes will be deployed to the UAT environment. You can test your changes using the [RM UAT](https://t.me/scheduler_telebot) telegram bot. If your deployment is overridden by another PR, you may find and rerun your deployment at [Github Actions](https://github.com/huishun98/recurring-messages-telebot/actions) to redeploy your changes.
- A team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
