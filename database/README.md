## Files

This directory contains functions related to database.

1. [sheets.py](./sheets.py) — handles calls to the gsheet we currently use as our database, and can be easily tweaked to link to other databases like MongoDB
2. [mongo.py](./mongo.py) — in-progress (shifting db to mongo.py, hopefully will solve the duplicate entry issue)
